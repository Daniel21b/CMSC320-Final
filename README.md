Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Project
Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict stock market trends using comprehensive historical data. We focus on the stock prices of major financial services and banks, top tech companies, and key stock market indices. By examining these datasets, we aim to gain insights into the behavior of stock prices over time and understand the impact of significant events on the market.
Why We Are Choosing This Dataset

The chosen datasets are essential for several reasons:

    Historical Coverage: They provide extensive historical data from 2006 to 2024, covering key periods such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Diverse Sectors: By including financial services, banks, tech companies, and major market indices, we can perform a comprehensive analysis across different sectors.
    Event Impact Analysis: These datasets allow us to examine the effects of significant events (e.g., financial crises, political changes) on stock prices, offering valuable insights into market behavior.
